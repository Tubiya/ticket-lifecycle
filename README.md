First you must make an ticket as an end-user,to do this you have to sign in as the user that you craeted. Make the ticket (entire mobile/online banking system is down).

</p>
<p>
Now Work the ticket to completion as your Sysadmins Agent
  
Set Properties to all the tickets; do SEV-A (SysAdmins last), observe ticket becomes inaccessible
Switch to admin panel and assign yourself View-access to Sys Admins
Switch to agent panel and observe the escalated ticket
Observe that you can no longer make changes to it

Solve all of the tickets
Explain in most ticketing systems (probably this one too) there is an email capability so every time you update the ticket, the user gets a copy and they can respond

Explain ticket intake IRL:
Sometimes tickets get created via phone, chat app, email, web form, or maybe even you run into someone in your hall or they roll up on you at your desk.
A lot of the time people will randomize you and try to get you to fix stuff on the spot. It’s fine to fix things on the spot, but generally speaking, you want to create tickets for EVERYTHING you do. (metrics are important)

Finishing up and additional practice
Obviously there is much more to this product that covered here
Encourage the use and exploration of the email feature
Do this lab a few more times, enough times where you’re able to implement it with this simple checklist. This will build your intuition.
Talk about Technical skill pillar
Re-touch on technical ability and re-doing the lab several
